    The Silhouette Coefficient is defined for each sample and is composed of two scores:
        a: The mean distance between a sample and all other points in the same class.
        b: The mean distance between a sample and all other points in the next nearest cluster.

    The Silhouette Coefficient s for a single sample is then given as:
        s = b - a / max(a, b)

    The score is bounded between -1 for incorrect clustering and +1 for highly dense clustering.
    Scores around zero indicate overlapping clusters.
    The score is higher when clusters are dense and well separated, which relates to a standard concept of a cluster.
    The Silhouette Coefficient is generally higher for convex clusters than other concepts of clusters,
        such as density based clusters like those obtained through DBSCAN.

    See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#silhouette-coefficient for more details.
